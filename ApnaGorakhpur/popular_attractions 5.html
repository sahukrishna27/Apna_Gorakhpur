                    <p>Geeta Vatika was founded in 1965 by Mahant Avaidyanath, the then-head of the Gorakhnath Matth. The matth is a Hindu monastery that has been in existence for over 1,000 years. Mahant Avaidyanath was a scholar of the Bhagavad Gita, and he wanted to create a garden that would be a place for people to learn about the text and to meditate on its teachings.
