                        History of Terracotta Art

                    <p>The history of terracotta art in Gorakhpur dates back to the 6th century BCE. The earliest
                        terracotta figurines from the region were found at the site of the ancient city of Kushanagari.
                        These figurines depict a variety of subjects, including animals, humans, and religious deities.
                        In the 11th century CE, the terracotta art of Gorakhpur reached its peak. During this period,
                        the region was ruled by the Pala Empire, which was a major patron of the arts. The Palas
                        commissioned the creation of a number of large-scale terracotta sculptures, including the famous
                        Buddhas of Sarnath.
